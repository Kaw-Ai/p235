# Domain Variation Examples

Examples showing how the same organizational pattern concept is expressed differently across the 5 domains.

## Independent domains

*Source: 12610010.md*

### Template (Generic)
> Balance between domains will not be achieved unless each one is small and autonomous enough to be an independent sphere of influence.

### Physical Domain
> Metropolitan regions will not come to balance until each one is small and autonomous enough to be an independent sphere of influence. Whenever possible, evolution of such regions should be encouraged; each with its own natural and geographic boundaries; each with its own economy; each one autonomous and self-governing.

### Social Domain
> Major networks or communities of organizations will not come to functional balance until each one is small and autonomous enough to be an independent sphere of influence.

### Conceptual Domain
> Major paradigms, networks of concepts or schools of thought will not come to functional balance until each one is sufficiently well-defined and autonomous to be an independent sphere of insight.

### Psychic Domain
> Major modes of awareness will not come to functional balance within the individual until each one is sufficiently well-defined and autonomous to be an independent sphere of influence.

## Distribution of organization

*Source: 12610020.md*

### Template (Generic)
> If a domain is characterized by small clusters of organization to too great an extent, more comprehensive forms of organization cannot emerge. But if a domain is characterized by large clusters of organization to too great an extent, such organization will not be able to ensure the integrity of the domain.

### Physical Domain
> If the population of a region is comprised of too many small villages, advanced civilization is unlikely to be generated; but if a region has too many large cities, the surrounding area will go to ruin for there will be no populace there to tend to it. The population needs to be distributed evenly in towns of different sizes, and the towns of the same size need to be distributed evenly throughout the region.

### Social Domain
> If a functional domain is characterized by smaller groups to too great an extent, larger and more complex forms of organization cannot emerge. But if such a domain is characterized by larger and more complex forms of organization to too great an extent, such forms of organization will prove detrimental to the integrity of the functional domain. Groups of different size and degrees of organization should be distributed evenly throughout the functional domain.

### Conceptual Domain
> If a conceptual domain is characterized by small networks or groups of concepts to too great an extent, more integrated and comprehensive forms of organization cannot emerge. But if such a domain is characterized by extensively organized networks of concepts to too great an extent, such a degree of organization will prove detrimental to the integrity of the conceptual domain. Bodies of knowledge of different degrees of organization should be distributed evenly throughout the domain.

### Psychic Domain
> If a mode of awareness is characterized by too many aspects of limited degree of organization, more integrated and comprehensive forms of awareness cannot emerge. But if such a mode of awareness is characterized by too limited a number of highly organized aspects, then this manner of organization will prove detrimental to the integrity of that mode of awareness.

## Interpretation of complementary modes of organization

*Source: 12610030.md*

### Template (Generic)
> A continuous pattern of organization and definition denies the existence and emergence of the underdefined and severely diminishes the value of major established patterns of organization. But the degree of integration of such major patterns is also valuable and potent. A compromise can be achieved by ensuring appropriate interpenetration of defined and underdefined modes of organization as complements.

### Physical Domain
> Massive urban environments render life mechanized and harsh and detract from enjoyment and health from enjoyment and health. But the size of cities is potent. Interlocking fingers of farmland and urban land are an appropriate compromise, even at the centre of the metropolis.

### Social Domain
> The proliferation of total patterns of organization and systems of procedures denies the existence and emergence of unorganized activity and severely diminishes the value of major institutions. But the degree of integration of such institutions is also valuable and potent. A compromise can be achieved by ensuring the interpenetration of formal and informal modes of organization as necessary complements.

### Conceptual Domain
> The proliferation of totally organized bodies of knowledge and conceptual methods ignores the existence and emergence of underdefined concepts and forms of integration with the consequence that conceptual development is severely inhibited. But the degree of integration of such established bodies of knowledge is also valuable and potent. A compromise can be achieved by ensuring the interpenetration of formal and informal modes of conceptual organization.

### Psychic Domain
> The proliferation of highly structured modes of awareness ignores the existence and emergence of underdefined modes of awareness and forms of integration, with the consequence that personal development is severely inhibited. But the degree of integration of such established modes of awareness is also valuable and potent. A compromise can be achieved by ensuring the interpenetration of structured and unstructured modes of awareness.

## Regenerative resource cultivation areas

*Source: 12610040.md*

### Template (Generic)
> Those areas in which resources can best be regenerated are also those most favourable for the construction of frameworks. The availability of such areas is however limited and once denatured by the construction of frameworks, its resource regeneration function cannot easily be recovered. Such areas should therefore be protected.

### Physical Domain
> The land which is best for agriculture happens to be best for building too. It is however limited and once the fertility is destroyed or locked up it cannot be regained for centuries. Agricultural valleys should therefore be protected as farmland or as nature reserves, if they are not cultivated.

### Social Domain
> The functional areas most favourable to regeneration of social resources are also those in which organizations can most easily be established. The availability of such areas is however limited and once denatured by the establishment of organizations, their resource regeneration function cannot easily be recovered. Such functional areas should therefore be protected from attempts at organization.

### Conceptual Domain
> The domains most favourable to regeneration of creative resources are also those in which concepts can most easily be ordered into conceptual frameworks. The availability of such areas is however limited and once denatured by the establishment of such frameworks their function in regenerating creative resources cannot easily be recovered. Such creative domains should therefore be protected from attempts at conceptual organization.

### Psychic Domain
> The modes of awareness most favourable to regeneration of psychic resources are also those which lend themselves most easily to being structured. The availability of such modes is however limited and once denatured by being structured in this way, their regenerative function cannot easily be recovered. Such modes of awareness should therefore be protected from efforts to structure them.

## Network of inter-relationships

*Source: 12610050.md*

### Template (Generic)
> There is advantage in relating to centrally organized frameworks as well as to those which are minimally organized. In order to reconcile these contradictory requirements, a network of inter-relationships is necessary which both links the limited number of central positions to the many non-central, minimally- organized areas, and provides a barrier to encroachment on such areas.

### Physical Domain
> Many people want to live in the country whilst also living close to a large city. It is however geometrically impossible to have thousands of small farms within a few minutes of a major city. Both are possible by arranging a loose network of country roads around large open squares of countryside or farmland, with houses closely packed along the road, but only one house deep. In these terms, the suburb is an obsolete and contradictory form of human settlement.

### Social Domain
> There is advantage in participation in major groups and local communities. In order to reconcile these mutually incompatible forms of activity, a loose network of relationships is necessary which links both the limited number of central organizations to the many non-central, minimally organized groups and ensures that the latter provide protection against external encroachment.

### Conceptual Domain
> There is advantage in major conceptual frameworks as well as in minimally organized conceptual processes. In order to reconcile these mutually incompatible forms of conceptual organization a loose network of relationships is necessary which links both the limited number of centrally organized frameworks to the minimally organized conceptual processes and ensures that the latter provide protection against progressive formalization.

### Psychic Domain
> There is advantage in highly ordered modes of awareness as well as in minimally ordered modes of awareness. In order to reconcile these mutually incompatible modes a loose network of associative relationships is necessary which links both the limited number of ordered modes to the minimally ordered modes and ensures that the latter provide protection against loss of the former.
