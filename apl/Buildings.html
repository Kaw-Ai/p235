      <p class="patternlanguage">We now start that part of the language which 
        gives shape to groups of buildings, and individual buildings, on the land, 
        in three dimensions. These are the patterns which can be <span class="italic">designed</span> 
        or <span class="italic">built</span>- the patterns which define the individual 
        buildings and the space between buildings; where we are dealing f or the 
        first time with patterns that are under the control of individuals or 
        small groups of individuals, who are able to build the patterns all at 
        once. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">The first group of patterns helps to lay out 
        the overall arrangement of a group of buildings: the height and number 
        of these buildings, the entrances to the site, main parking areas and 
        lines of movement through the complex. </p>
      <p class="italic"><img src="./Buildings_files/threedots.gif" width="181" height="56"></p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">We assume, based on the instructions in <span class="italic">Summary 
        of the Language</span>, that you have already constructed a sequence of 
        patterns. We shall now go through a step-by-step procedure for building 
        this sequence into a design.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">1. </span>The basic instruction 
        is this: take the patterns in the order of sequence, one by one, and let 
        the form grow from the fusion of these patterns, the site, and your own 
        instincts. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">2. </span>It is essential 
        to work on the site, where the project is to be built; inside the room 
        that is to be remodeled; on the land where the building is to go up; and 
        so forth. And as far as possible, work with the people that are actually 
        going to use the place when it is finished: if you are the user, all the 
        better. But, above all, work on the site, stay on the site, <span class="italic">let 
        the site tell you its secrets</span>. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">3.</span> Remember too, 
        that the form will grow gradually as you go through the sequence, beginning 
        as something very loose and amorphous, gradually becoming more and more 
        complicated, more refined and more differentiated, more finished. Don't 
        rush this process. Don't give the form more order than it needs to meet 
        the patterns and the conditions of the site, each step of the way. In 
        effect, as you build each pattern into the design, you will experience 
        a single gestalt that is gradually becoming more and more coherent. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">4.</span> Take one pattern 
        at a time. Open the page to the first one and read it again. The pattern 
        statement describes the ways in which other patterns either influence 
        this pattern or are influenced by it. <span class="italic">For now</span>, 
        this information is useful only in so far as it helps you to envision<span class="italic"> 
        the one pattern before you, as a whole</span>. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">5. </span>Now try to imagine 
        how, on your particular site, you can establish this pattern. Stand on 
        the site with your eyes closed. Imagine how things might be if the pattern 
        as you understood it, had suddenly sprung up there overnight. Once you 
        have an image of how it might be, walk about the site, pacing out approximate 
        areas, marking the walls, using string and cardboard, and putting stakes 
        in the ground, or loose stones, to mark the important corners. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">6. </span>Complete your 
        thought about this pattern, before you go on to the next one. This means 
        you must treat the pattern as an "entity"; and try to conceive 
        of this entity, entire and whole, before you start creating any other 
        patterns. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">7. </span>The sequence 
        of the language will guarantee that you will not have to make enormous 
        changes which cancel out your earlier decisions. Instead, the changes 
        you make will get smaller and smaller, as you build in more and more patterns, 
        like a series of progressive refinements, until you have a complete design.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">8. </span>Since you are 
        building up your design, one pattern at a time, it is essential to keep 
        your design as fluid as possible, while you go from pattern to pattern. 
        As you use the patterns, one after another, you will find that you keep 
        needing to adjust your design to accommodate new patterns. It is important 
        that you do this in a loose, relaxed way, without getting the design more 
        fixed than necessary, and without being afraid to make changes. The design 
        can change as it needs to, so long as you maintain the essential relationships 
        and characteristics which earlier patterns have prescribed. You will see 
        that it is possible to keep these essentials constant, and still make 
        minor changes in the design. S you include each new pattern, you readjust 
        the total gestalt of your design to bring it into line with the pattern 
        you are working on.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">9. </span>While you are 
        imagining how to establish one pattern, consider the other patterns listed 
        with it. Some are larger. Some are smaller. For the larger ones, try to 
        see how they can one day be present in the areas you are now working on, 
        and ask yourself how the pattern you are now building can contribute to 
        the repair or formation of these larger patterns. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">10. </span>For the smaller 
        ones, make sure your conception of the main pattern will allow you to 
        make these smaller patterns within it later. It will probably be helpful 
        if you try to decide roughly how you are going to build these smaller 
        patterns in, when you come to them. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">11. </span>Keep track of 
        the area from the very beginning so that you are always reasonably close 
        to something you can actually afford. We have had many experiences in 
        which people try to design their own houses or other buildings, and then 
        get discouraged because the final cost is too high, and they have to go 
        back and change it.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">To do this, decide on a budget and use a reasonable 
        average square foot cost to translate this budget into square feet construction. 
        Say for the sake of argument that you have a budget of $30,000 for construction. 
        With help from builders, find out what kind of building you are making. 
        For example, in 1976 in California, a reasonable house, compatible with 
        the patterns in the last part of the language can be built for $28/ square 
        foot. If you want expensive finishes it will be more. With $36,000 for 
        construction, this will give you some 1300 square feet.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">12.</span> Now throughout 
        the design process, keep this 1300-square-foot figure in mind. If you 
        go to two stories, keep the ground area to 650 square feet. If you use 
        only part of the upstairs volume, the ground floor can go as high as 800 
        to 900 square feet. If you decide to build rather elaborate outdoor rooms, 
        walls, trellises, reduce the indoor area to make up for these outdoor 
        costs - perhaps down to 1100 or 1200. And each time you use a pattern 
        to differentiate the layout of your building further, keep this total 
        area in mind, so that you do not ever allow yourself to go beyond your 
        budget. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">13.</span> Finally, make 
        the essential points and lines which are needed to fix the pattern on 
        the site with bricks, sticks or stakes. Try not to design on paper; even 
        in the case of complicated buildings find a way to make your marks on 
        the site.</p>

        of the design process in action, are given in chapters 20, 21 and 22 of
