It is becoming the rule in modern design to seal up windows and create "perfect" indoor climates with mechanical air conditioning systems. This is crazy.
<P>

A window is your connection to the outside. It is a source of fresh air; a simple way of changing the temperature, quickly, when the room gets too hot or too cold; a place to hang out and smell the air and trees and flowers and the weather; and a hole through which people can talk to each other.
<P>

What is the best kind of window?
<P>

Double-hung windows cannot be fully opened - only half of the total window area can ever be opened at once. And they often get stuck - sometimes because they have been painted, sometimes because their concealed operating system of cords, counter-weights, and pulleys gets broken; it becomes such an effort to open them that no one bothers.
<P>

Sliding windows have much, of the same problem - only part of the window area can be open, since one panel goes behind another; and they often get stuck too.
<P>

The side hung casement is easy to open and close. It gives the greatest range of openings, and so creates the greatest degree of control over air and temperature; and it makes an opening which is large enough to put your head and shoulders through. It is the easiest window to climb in and out of too.
<P>

The old time French windows are a stunning example of this pattern. They are narrow, full length upstairs windows, which swing out onto a tiny balcony, large enough only to contain the open windows. When you open them you fill the frame, and can stand drinking in the air: they put you intensely close to the outside - yet in a perfectly urban sense, as much in Paris or Madrid as in the open countryside

Complete the subframe of the casement with <A HREF="../apl239/apl239.htm">SMALL PANES (239)</A>. . . .
