      <p class="patternlanguage">At this stage, you have a complete design for 
        an individual building. If you have followed the patterns given, you have 
        a scheme of spaces, either marked on the ground with stakes, or on a piece 
        of paper, accurate to the nearest foot or so. You know the height of rooms, 
        the rough size and position of windows and doors, and you know roughly 
        how the roofs of the building, and the gardens are laid out. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">The next, and last part of the language, tells 
        how to make a buildable building directly from this rough scheme of spaces, 
        and tells you how to build it in detail. Before you lay out structural 
        details, establish a philosophy of structure which will let the structure 
        grow directly from your plans and your conception of the buildings.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><img src="./Construction_files/threedots.gif" width="181" height="56"></p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">The patterns in this last section present a physical 
        attitude to construction that works together with the kinds of building 
        which the second part of the pattern language generates. These construction 
        patterns are intended for builders-whether professional builders or amateur 
        owner-builders.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">Each pattern states a principle about structure 
        and materials. These principles can be implemented in any number of ways 
        when it comes time for actual building. We have tried to state various 
        ways in which the principles can be built. But partly because the patterns 
        are the least developed, and partly because of the nature of building 
        patterns, the reader will very likely have much to add to these patterns. 
        For example, the actual materials used to implement them will vary greatly 
        from region to region . . .</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">Perhaps the main thing to bear in mind, as you 
        look over this material is this: Our intention in this section has been 
        to provide an alternative to the technocratic and rigid ways of building 
        that have become the legacy of the machine age and modern architecture. 
      </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">The way of building described here leads to buildings 
        that are unique and tailored to their sites. It depends on builders taking 
        responsibility for their work; and working out the details of the buildings 
        as they go-mocking up entrances and windows and dimensions of spaces, 
        making experiments and building directly according to the results. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">The patterns in this section are unique in several 
        ways.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">First the sequence of the patterns is more concrete 
        than in any of the earlier portions of the language. It not only corresponds 
        to the order in which a design matures <span class="italic">conceptually</span>, 
        in the user's mind, but also corresponds to the actual physical order 
        of construction. That is, except for the first four patterns, which deal 
        with structural philosophy, the remaining patterns can actually be used, 
        in the sequence given, to build a building. The sequence of the language 
        corresponds almost exactly to the actual sequence of operations on the 
        building site. In addition, the patterns themselves in this section are 
        both more concrete and more abstract than any other patterns in the book.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">They are more concrete because with each pattern, 
        we have always given at least one interpretation which can be built directly. 
        For instance, with the pattern <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl214.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2">Root Foundation</a> , we have given one particular interpretation to show how 
        it can be done, and also to give the reader an immediate and practical, 
        buildable approach to construction.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">Yet at the same time, they are also more abstract. 
        The particular concrete formulation which we have given for each pattern, 
        can also be interpreted and remade in a thousand ways. Thus it is also 
        possible to take the general idea of the pattern, the idea that the foundation 
        functions like a tree root in the way that it anchors the building to 
        the ground-and invent a dozen entirely different physical systems, which 
        all work in this fundamental way. In this sense, these patterns are more 
        abstract than any others in the book since they have a wider range of 
        possible interpretations.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">To illustrate the fact that a great variety of 
        actual building systems can be developed, based on these patterns, we 
        present three versions that we have developed in response to different 
        contexts.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">In Mexico: Concrete block foundations with rebar 
        connectors; hollow self-aligning molded earth blocks reinforced with bamboo 
        for walls and columns; burlap formed concrete beams; steep barrel vaults 
        with earth and asphalt coverings - everything whitewashed. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">In Peru: Slab floors poured integrally with wall 
        foundations; finished with soft baked tiles; hard wood (diablo fuerte) 
        columns and beams; plaster on bamboo lath acting as shear walls between 
        columns; diagonal wood plank ceilings/floors; bamboo lattice partitions.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">In Berkeley: Concrete slab finished with colored 
        wax; walls of exterior skin of 1 x boards and interior skin of gypboard 
        filled with lightweight concrete; box columns made of 1 x boards, filled 
        with lightweight concrete; 2-inch concrete ceiling/floor vaults formed 
        with wood lattice and burlap forms.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">As you can see from these examples, we have formulated 
        these patterns with very careful attention to cost. We have tried to give 
        examples of these patterns which use the cheapest and most easily available 
        materials; we have designed them in such a way that such buildings can 
        be built by lay people (who can therefore avoid the cost of labor altogether) 
        ; and we have designed it so that the cost of labor, if done professionally, 
        is low. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">Of the three parts of the language, this third 
        part is the least developed. Both the part of Towns and the part on Buildings 
        have been tested, one partially, the other very thoroughly in practice. 
        This third part has so far only been tested in a small number of relatively 
        minor buildings. That means obviously that this material needs a good 
        deal of improvement.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">However we intend as soon as possible, to test 
        all these patterns thoroughly in various different buildings - houses, 
        public buildings, details and additions. Once again, as soon as we have 
        enough examples to make it worth reporting on them, we shall publish another 
        volume which describes them and our findings.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">In many ways, rough though it is, this is the 
        most exciting part of the language, because it is here in these few patterns,. 
        that we can most vividly see a building literally grow before our eyes, 
        under the impact of the patterns.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">The actual process of construction, in which 
        the sequence of their patterns creates a building, is described in Chapter 
        23 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195024028/qid=1013424210/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_3_1/103-3258309-9162211" class="bolditalic">The 
        Timeless Way of Building</a>.</p>
