. . . in a public building, or an office where there are many people coming in, <A HREF="../apl80/apl80.htm">SELF-GOVERNING WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES (80)</A>, <A HREF="../apl81/apl81.htm">SMALL SERVICES WITHOUT RED TAPE (81)</A>, <A HREF="../apl91/apl91.htm">TRAVELER'S INN (91)</A>, <A HREF="../apl146/apl146.htm">FLEXIBLE OFFICE SPACE (146)</A> - the place inside the <A HREF="../apl130/apl130.htm">ENTRANCE ROOM (130)</A> plays an essential role; it must be built from the very start with the right atmosphere. This pattern was originally proposed by Clyde Dorsett of the National Institute of Mental Health, in a program for community mental health clinics.
</p>
<p><span class=h3class>Have you ever walked into a public building and been processed by the receptionist as if you were a package?
</span>
<P><span class=h3class>Therefore:</span>
<P>
<span class=h3class>Arrange a series of welcoming things immediately inside the entrance - soft chairs, a fireplace, food, coffee. Place the reception desk so that it is not between the receptionist and the welcoming area, but to one side at an angle - so that she, or he, can get up and walk toward the people who come in, greet them, and then invite them to sit down</span>

<P>
To make a person feel at ease, you must do the same for him as you would do to welcome him to your home; go toward him, greet him, offer him a chair, offer him some food and drink, and take his coat.
<P>

In most institutions the person arriving has to go toward the receptionist; the receptionist remains passive and offers nothing. To be welcoming the receptionist must initiate the action - come forward and greet the person, offer a chair, food, a seat by the fire, coffee. Since it is first impressions which count, this whole atmosphere should be the first thing a person encounters.
<P>

A beautiful example we know is the reception desk at Browns Hotel in London. You pass into the hotel through a small, unassuming entrance, not unlike the entrance to a house. You pass through two or three rooms; then come to the central room in which there are two old writing desks. The receptionist comes forward from an inner office, invites you to sit down in a com fortable chair at one of these writing desks, and sits down with you while you fill out the hotel register.
<P>

The reasons most reception areas fail completely to have this quality, is that the receptionist's desk forms a barrier, so that the desk and equipment together help to create an institutional atmosphere, quite at odds with the feeling of welcome.

Place the fireplace most carefully, to be a focus - <A HREF="../apl181/apl181.htm">THE FIRE (181)</A> give the receptionist a workspace where she can be comfortable in her own work, and still make visitors feel welcome <A HREF="../apl183/apl183.htm">WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE (183)</A>; give the space <A HREF="../apl159/apl159.htm">LIGHT ON TWO SIDES (159)</A>; perhaps put in an alcove or a window seat for people who are waiting - <A HREF="../apl150/apl150.htm">A PLACE TO WAIT (150)</A>, <A HREF="../apl179/apl179.htm">ALCOVES (179)</A>, <A HREF="../apl180/apl180.htm">WINDOW PLACE (180)</A>. Make sure that the reception point itself is lighter than surrounding areas - <A HREF="../apl135/apl135.htm">TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK (135)</A>. And for the shape of the reception space start with <A HREF="../apl191/apl191.htm">THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE (191)</A>. . . .
