174 &nbsp TRELLISED WALK

. . . suppose the main spots of the garden have been defined - <A HREF="../apl163/apl163.htm">OUTDOOR ROOM (163)</A>, <A HREF="../apl171/apl171.htm">TREE PLACES (171)</A>, <A HREF="../apl175/apl175.htm">GREENHOUSE (175)</A>, <A HREF="../apl170/apl170.htm">FRUIT TREES (170)</A>. Now, where there is a special need to emphasize a path - <A HREF="../apl120/apl120.htm">PATHS AND GOALS (120)</A> - or, even more important, where the edges between two parts of a garden need to be marked without making a wall, an open trellised walk which can enclose space, is required. Above all, these trellised walks help to form the <A HREF="../apl106/apl106.htm">POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACES (106)</A> in a garden or a park; and may perhaps help to form an <A HREF="../apl112/apl112.htm">ENTRANCE TRANSITION (112)</A>.

<p><span class=h3class>Trellised walks have their own special beauty. They are so unique, so different from other ways of shaping a path, that they are almost archetypal.
</span>
<P><span class=h3class>Therefore:</span>
<P>
<span class=h3class>Where paths need special protection or where they need some intimacy, build a trellis over the path and plant it with climbing flowers. Use the trellis to help shape the outdoor spaces on either side of it.</span>

<P>
In <A HREF="../apl121/apl121.htm">PATH SHAPE (121)</A>, we have described the need for outdoor paths to have a shape, like rooms. In <A HREF="../apl106/apl106.htm">POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE (106)</A>, we have explained the need for larger outdoor areas to have positive shape. A trellised walk does both. It makes it possible to implement both these patterns at the same time - simply and elegantly. But it does it in such a fundamental way that we have decided to treat it as a separate pattern; and we shall try to define the places where a trellised structure over a path is appropriate.
<P>
1. Use it to emphasize the path it covers, and to set off one part of the path as a special section of a longer path in order to make it an especially nice and inviting place to walk.

<div align="center"><I>A trellis gives shape to an outdoor area.</I></div>
</p>
<p>
2. Since the trellised path creates enclosure around the spaces which it bounds, use it to create a virtual wall to define an outdoor space. For example, a trellised walk can form an enormous outdoor room by surrounding, or partially surrounding, a garden.

Think about the columns that support the trellis as themselves capable of creating places - seats, bird feeders - <A HREF="../apl226/apl226.htm">COLUMN PLACES (226)</A>. Pave the path with loosely set stones - <A HREF="../apl247/apl247.htm">PAVING WITH CRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES (247)</A> - Use climbing plants and a fine trellis work to create the special quality of soft, filtered light underneath the trellis - <A HREF="../apl238/apl238.htm">FILTERED LIGHT (238)</A>, <A HREF="../apl246/apl246.htm">CLIMBING PLANTS (246)</A> . . . .
