      <p class="italic">"People say, A Pattern Language changes their lives, 
        by which I think they mean it changes the way they physically organize 
        their lives... What Alexander and his co-authors set out to do was collect 
        and organize the elements that make buildings loved, that make buildings 
        'live'. Freed from modernity, they teased out the deep-dwelling 'pattern 
        language' that people understand buildings with... Every year some 10,000 
        copies of this $50 biblical tome are bought, and the number increases 
        yearly."</p>

        Pattern Language</a> is a philosophy of the human use of space and an 
        analysis of what makes humans comfortable in the space they inhabit -

      <p class="patternlanguage">Each pattern starts out with a design challenge, 
        such as: </p>

      <p class="patternlanguage">The patterns explore the problem in depth and 
        then state a solution, linking to preceding and concluding patterns that 
        relate to the subject at hand. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">You and your neighbors can use it as a tool to 
        improve your neighborhood, an individual can use it to design a home or 
        office, and it can also function as a guide in the process of construction.

      <p class="patternlanguage">Reading A Pattern Language changed the way I 
        look at the world. It's the one book I won't loan to friends, but creating 
        a website made sharing easy. Its linked hierarchy of patterns made it 
        perfect for linking, and clicking from pattern to pattern is more efficient 
        than flipping pages. The web also allowed me to index its 1100 pages. 
        Copyright issues are a concern, so the site is obscured from search engines 
        and shared only with friends and as part of my portfolio. </p>

        stated a solution to provide the reader with at least one way of solving 
        the problem - but finding the true invariant which lies at the heart of 
        all possible solutions to this problem remains undone. </span></p>
