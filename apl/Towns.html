      <p class="italic">We begin with that part of the language which defines 
        a town or a community. These patterns can never be designed<span class="patternlanguage"> 
        or</span> built in one fell swoop -- but patient piecemeal growth, designed 
        in such a way that every individual act is always helping to create or 
        generate these larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the 
        years, make a community that has these global patterns in it. First, one 
        all important comment about the region as a whole.</p>
      <p class="header2"><img src="./Towns_files/threedots.gif" width="181" height="56"></p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">The first 94 patterns deal with the large-scale 
        structure of the environment: the growth of town and country, the layout 
        of roads and paths, the relationship between work and family, the formation 
        of suitable public institutions for a neighborhood, the kinds of public 
        space required to support these institutions.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">We believe that the patterns [presented in this 
        section can be implemented best by piecemeal processes, where each project 
        built or each planning decision made is sanctioned by the community according 
        as it does or does not help to form certain large-scale patterns. <span class="italic">We 
        do not believe that these large patterns, which give so much structure 
        to a town or of a neighborhood, can be created by centralized authority, 
        or by laws or master plans.</span> We believe instead that they can emerge 
        gradually and organically, almost of their own accord, if every act of 
        building, large or small, takes on the responsibility for gradually shaping 
        its small corner of the world to make these larger patterns appear there.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">In the next few pages we shall describe a planning 
        process which we believe is compatible with this piecemeal approach.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">1. </span>The core of the 
        planning process we [propose is this: The region is made up of a hierarchy 
        of social and political groups, from the smallest and most local groups 
        - families, neighborhoods, and work groups - to the largest groups - city 
        councils, regional assemblies.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">Imagine for example a metropolitan region composed 
        very roughly of the following groups, each group a coherent political 
        entity:<br>
      </p>

      </tbody></table>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header1">2. </span><span class="italic">Each 
        group makes its own decisions about the environment it uses in common.</span> 
        Ideally, each group actually owns the common land at its "level." 
        And higher groups do not own or control the land belonging ti lower groups 
        - the only own and control the common land that lies <span class="italic">between</span> 
        them, which serves the higher group. For instance, a community of 7000 
        might own the public land lying between its component neighborhoods, but 
        not the neighborhoods themselves. A cooperative house cluster would own 
        the common land between the houses, but not the houses themselves.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">3. </span>Each of these 
        groups takes responsibility for those patterns relevant to its own internal 
        structure. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">Thus, we imagine, for example, that the various 
        groups we have named might choose to adopt the following patterns:</p>

      <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">4. </span>Each neighborhood, 
        community or city is then free to find various ways of persuading its 
        constituent groups and individuals to implement these patterns gradually. 
      </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">In every case this will hinge on some kind of 
        incentive. However the actual incentives might vary greatly, in their 
        power, and degree of enforcement. Some patterns, like <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl003.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2">City Country Fingers</a>, might be made a matter of regional law- since nothing 
        less can deter money-hungry developers from building everywhere. Other 
        patterns, like <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl053.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2">Main Gateways</a>, <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl065.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2"> 
        Birth Places</a>, <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl071.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2">Still Water</a> might be purely voluntary. And other patterns might have various 
        kinds of incentives, intermediate between these extremes.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">For example, <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl052.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2">Network of Paths and Cars</a>, <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl060.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2">Accessible Green</a>, and others might be formulated so that tax breaks will be given 
        to those development projects which help bring them into existence. </p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">5. As far as possible, implementation should 
        be loose and voluntary, based on social responsibility, and not on legislation 
        or coercion.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">Suppose, for example, that there is a citywide 
        decision to increase industrial uses in certain areas. Within the process 
        here defined, the city could not implement this policy over the heads 
        of the neighborhoods, by zoning or the power of eminent domain or any 
        other actions. They can suggest that it is important, and can increase 
        the flow of money to any neighborhoods willing to help implement this 
        larger pattern. They can implement it, in short, if they can find local 
        neighborhoods willing to modify their own environment to help make it 
        happen locally. AS they find such neighborhoods, then it will happen gradually, 
        over a period of years, as the local neighborhoods respond to the incentives.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">6. Once such a process is rolling, a community, 
        having adopted the pattern<a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl047.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2"> 
        Health Center</a>, for example, might invite a group of doctors to come 
        and build such a place. The team of users designing the clinic would work 
        from the <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl047.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2">Health Center</a> pattern, and all the other relevant patterns that are part 
        of the community's language. They would try to build into their project 
        any higher patterns that the community has developed - <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl022.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2">Nine Percent Parking</a>, <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl072.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2"> 
        Local Sports</a>, <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl052.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2">Network of Paths and Cars</a>, <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl060.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2">Accessible Green</a>, etc.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">7. It is of course possible for individual acts 
        of building to begin working their way toward these larger communal patterns, 
        even before the neighborhood, community and regional groups are formed.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">Thus, for example, a group of people seeking 
        to get rid of noisy and dangerous traffic in front of their houses might 
        decide to tear up the asphalt and build a <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl051.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2">Green Street</a> there instead. They would present their case to the traffic 
        department based on the arguments presented in the pattern, and on analysis 
        of the existing street pattern.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">Another group wanting to build a small communal 
        workshop, in a neighborhood currently zoned for residential use only, 
        can argue their case based on <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl009.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2">Scattered Work</a>, <a href="https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl156.htm" target="mainFrame" class="header2">Settled Work</a>, etc., and possibly get the city or zoning department to change 
        the zoning regulation on this matter, and thereby slowly work toward introducing 
        patterns, one at a time within the current framework of codes and zoning.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">We have worked out a partial version of this 
        process at the Eugene campus of the University of Oregon. That work is 
        described in Volume 3 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195018249/qid=1013424253/sr=2-3/ref=sr_2_3/103-3258309-9162211" class="bolditalic">The 
        Oregon Experiment</a>. But a university is quite different from a town, 
        because it has a single centralized owner, and a single source of funds. 
        It is inevitable therefore, that the process by which individual acts 
        can work together to for larger wholes without restrictive planning from 
        above, can only partly be put into practice there.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">&nbsp;The theory which explains how large patterns 
        can be build piecemeal from smaller ones, is given in Chapters 24 and 
        25 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195024028/qid=1013424210/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_3_1/103-3258309-9162211" class="bolditalic">The 
        Timeless Way of Building</a>.</p>
      <p class="patternlanguage">At some time in the future, we hope to write 
        another volume, which explains the political and economic processes needed 
        to implement this process fully, in a town. </p>
