167 &nbsp SIX-FOOT BALCONY

. . . in various places <A HREF="../apl119/apl119.htm">ARCADES (119)</A> and <A HREF="../apl166/apl166.htm">GALLERY, SURROUND (166)</A> have helped you to imagine some kind of a balcony, veranda, terrace, porch, arcade along the building edge or halfway into it. This pattern simply specifies the depth of this arcade or porch or balcony, to make sure that it really works.

<P>
<span class=h3class>Whenever you build a balcony, a porch, a gallery, or a terrace always make it at least six feet deep. If possible, recess at least a part of it into the building so that it is not cantilevered out and separated from the building by a simple line, and enclose it partially.</span>

Balconies and porches are often made very small to save money; but when they are too small, they might just as well not be there.
<P>

A balcony is first used properly when there is enough room for two or three people to sit in a small group with room to stretch their legs, and room for a small table where they can set down glasses, cups, and the newspaper. No balcony works if it is so narrow that people have to sit in a row facing outward. The critical size is hard to determine, but it is at least six feet. The following drawing and photograph show roughly why:
</p>
<p>
<div align="center"><IMG SRC="apl167diagram2.jpg"  WIDTH=200>
</p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="apl167photo2.jpg"  WIDTH=200></div>
<div align="center"><I>Six feet deep.</I></div>
</p>
<p>
Our observations make it clear that the difference between deep balconies and those which are not deep enough is simply astonishing. In our experience, almost no balconies at all which are 3 or 4 feet deep manage to gather life to them or to get used. And almost no balconies which are more than six feet deep are not used.
</p>
<p>
<div align="center"><IMG SRC="apl167photo3.jpg"  WIDTH=300></div>

<div align="center"><I>Narrow balconies are useless.</I></div>
</p>
<p>
Two other features of the balcony make a difference in the degree to which people will use it: its enclosure and its recession into the building.
</p>
<p>
As far as enclosure goes, we have noticed that among the deeper balconies, it is those with half-open enclosures around them - columns, wooden slats, rose-covered trellises - which are used most. Apparently, the partial privacy given by a half-open screen makes people more comfortable - see <A HREF="../apl193/apl193.htm">HALF-OPEN WALL (193)</A>
</p>
<p>
<div align="center"><IMG SRC="apl167diagram3.jpg"  WIDTH=200></div>
<div align="center"><I>Not this</I> . . . &nbsp &nbsp . . . <I>this</I>.</div>
</p>
<p>
And recesses seem to have a similar effect. On a cantilevered balcony people must sit outside the mass of the building; the balcony lacks privacy and tends to feel unsafe. In an English study ("Private Balconies in Flats and Maisonettes," <I>Architect's Journal,</I> March 1957, pp. 372-76), two-thirds of the people that never used their balconies gave lack of privacy as their reason, and said that they preferred recessed balconies, because, in contrast to cantilevered balconies, the recesses seemed more secure.

Enclose the balcony with a low wall - <A HREF="../apl243/apl243.htm">SITTING WALL (243)</A>, heavy columns - <A HREF="../apl226/apl226.htm">COLUMN PLACES (226)</A>, and half-open walls or screens - <A HREF="../apl193/apl193.htm">HALF-OPEN WALL (193)</A>. Keep it open toward the south - <A HREF="../apl161/apl161.htm">SUNNY PLACE (161)</A>. Treat it as an <A HREF="../apl163/apl163.htm">OUTDOOR ROOM (163)</A>, and get the details of its shape and its construction from <A HREF="../apl191/apl191.htm">THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE (191)</A>. . . .
