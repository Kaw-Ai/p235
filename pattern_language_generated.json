    "problem_details": "Continuous urbanization destroys life, modern architecture creates sterile environments, and there is a need for a systematic way to understand and create spaces that support human life. The challenge is to organize design knowledge in a way that can be shared, learned, and applied across different scales from regions to construction details.",
    "solution": "Create a structured language of 253 interconnected patterns organized hierarchically from large-scale regional planning (Towns) to building design (Buildings) to construction details (Construction). Each pattern addresses a recurring design problem with a proven solution, linked to related patterns in a network that guides the design process.",
