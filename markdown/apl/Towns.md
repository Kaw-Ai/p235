![](./Towns_files/townshedbl.gif) We begin with that part of the language which defines a town or a community. These patterns can never be designed or built in one fell swoop -- but patient piecemeal growth, designed in such a way that every individual act is always helping to create or generate these larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the years, make a community that has these global patterns in it. First, one all important comment about the region as a whole. ![](./Towns_files/threedots.gif) The first 94 patterns deal with the large-scale structure of the environment: the growth of town and country, the layout of roads and paths, the relationship between work and family, the formation of suitable public institutions for a neighborhood, the kinds of public space required to support these institutions. We believe that the patterns [presented in this section can be implemented best by piecemeal processes, where each project built or each planning decision made is sanctioned by the community according as it does or does not help to form certain large-scale patterns. We do not believe that these large patterns, which give so much structure to a town or of a neighborhood, can be created by centralized authority, or by laws or master plans. We believe instead that they can emerge gradually and organically, almost of their own accord, if every act of building, large or small, takes on the responsibility for gradually shaping its small corner of the world to make these larger patterns appear there. In the next few pages we shall describe a planning process which we believe is compatible with this piecemeal approach. 1\. The core of the planning process we [propose is this: The region is made up of a hierarchy of social and political groups, from the smallest and most local groups \- families, neighborhoods, and work groups - to the largest groups - city councils, regional assemblies. Imagine for example a metropolitan region composed very roughly of the following groups, each group a coherent political entity:  
| A. The region: | 8,000,000 people.  
---|---  
B. The major city:  | 500,000 people.  
C. Communities and small towns:  | 5-10,000 people each.  
D. Neighborhoods: | 500-1000 people each.  
E. Families and work groups: | 1-15 people each.  
2\. Each group makes its own decisions about the environment it uses in common. Ideally, each group actually owns the common land at its "level." And higher groups do not own or control the land belonging ti lower groups \- the only own and control the common land that lies between them, which serves the higher group. For instance, a community of 7000 might own the public land lying between its component neighborhoods, but not the neighborhoods themselves. A cooperative house cluster would own the common land between the houses, but not the houses themselves.
3\. Each of these groups takes responsibility for those patterns relevant to its own internal structure. 
Thus, we imagine, for example, that the various groups we have named might choose to adopt the following patterns:
A. Region:  |  [Independent Regions](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl001.htm) . .  
---|---  
[The Distribution of Towns](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl002.htm)  
[ City Country Fingers](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl003.htm) .  
B. City: | [Mosaic of Subcultures](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl008.htm) . .  
[Scattered Work](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl009.htm)  
[Magic of the City](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl010.htm) .  
C. Community: |  [Community of 7000](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl012.htm)  
[Subculture Boundary](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl013.htm) . .   
4\. Each neighborhood, community or city is then free to find various ways of persuading its constituent groups and individuals to implement these patterns gradually. 
In every case this will hinge on some kind of incentive. However the actual incentives might vary greatly, in their power, and degree of enforcement. Some patterns, like [City Country Fingers](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl003.htm), might be made a matter of regional law- since nothing less can deter money-hungry developers from building everywhere. Other patterns, like [Main Gateways](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl053.htm), [ Birth Places](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl065.htm), [Still Water](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl071.htm) might be purely voluntary. And other patterns might have various kinds of incentives, intermediate between these extremes.
For example, [Network of Paths and Cars](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl052.htm), [Accessible Green](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl060.htm), and others might be formulated so that tax breaks will be given to those development projects which help bring them into existence. 
5\. As far as possible, implementation should be loose and voluntary, based on social responsibility, and not on legislation or coercion.
Suppose, for example, that there is a citywide decision to increase industrial uses in certain areas. Within the process here defined, the city could not implement this policy over the heads of the neighborhoods, by zoning or the power of eminent domain or any other actions. They can suggest that it is important, and can increase the flow of money to any neighborhoods willing to help implement this larger pattern. They can implement it, in short, if they can find local neighborhoods willing to modify their own environment to help make it happen locally. AS they find such neighborhoods, then it will happen gradually, over a period of years, as the local neighborhoods respond to the incentives.
6\. Once such a process is rolling, a community, having adopted the pattern[ Health Center](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl047.htm), for example, might invite a group of doctors to come and build such a place. The team of users designing the clinic would work from the [Health Center](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl047.htm) pattern, and all the other relevant patterns that are part of the community's language. They would try to build into their project any higher patterns that the community has developed - [Nine Percent Parking](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl022.htm), [ Local Sports](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl072.htm), [Network of Paths and Cars](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl052.htm), [Accessible Green](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl060.htm), etc.
7\. It is of course possible for individual acts of building to begin working their way toward these larger communal patterns, even before the neighborhood, community and regional groups are formed.
Thus, for example, a group of people seeking to get rid of noisy and dangerous traffic in front of their houses might decide to tear up the asphalt and build a [Green Street](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl051.htm) there instead. They would present their case to the traffic department based on the arguments presented in the pattern, and on analysis of the existing street pattern.
Another group wanting to build a small communal workshop, in a neighborhood currently zoned for residential use only, can argue their case based on [Scattered Work](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl009.htm), [Settled Work](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl156.htm), etc., and possibly get the city or zoning department to change the zoning regulation on this matter, and thereby slowly work toward introducing patterns, one at a time within the current framework of codes and zoning.
We have worked out a partial version of this process at the Eugene campus of the University of Oregon. That work is described in Volume 3 of [The Oregon Experiment](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195018249/qid=1013424253/sr=2-3/ref=sr_2_3/103-3258309-9162211). But a university is quite different from a town, because it has a single centralized owner, and a single source of funds. It is inevitable therefore, that the process by which individual acts can work together to for larger wholes without restrictive planning from above, can only partly be put into practice there.
The theory which explains how large patterns can be build piecemeal from smaller ones, is given in Chapters 24 and 25 of [The Timeless Way of Building](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195024028/qid=1013424210/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_3_1/103-3258309-9162211).
At some time in the future, we hope to write another volume, which explains the political and economic processes needed to implement this process fully, in a town.
