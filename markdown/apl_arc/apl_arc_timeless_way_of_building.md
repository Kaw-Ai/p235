# The Timeless Way of Building (Archetypal Variant)

## Archetypal Pattern

# The Timeless Way of {{structures}}

The {{settlements}} that are alive are always grown from the inside, by the ordinary acts of {{agents}} who create {{{{structures}}}} and {{{{spaces}}}} which are adapted to their own nature and their own {{processes}}.

When {{agents}} have the freedom to act in response to the forces they feel directly, they will create {{{{structures}}}} which are perfectly adapted to those forces, and, through the repetition of this process, over many years, the whole {{settlement}} will develop into a totality which is at peace with itself, and beautiful.

The quality without a name is the most fundamental quality there is in anything. It is the quality that makes the difference between what is alive and what is dead. It is a quality which belongs to whole systems. It is the source of all real {{processes}}, all real freedom, all real life.

In the end, this quality cannot be made, but only generated, indirectly, by the ordinary {{agents}} of a place, doing everything which makes them feel alive.
