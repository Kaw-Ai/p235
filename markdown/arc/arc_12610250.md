# 12610250 - Relationship to indeterminacy (Archetypal)

## Archetypal Pattern

The significance of a domain of defined relationships is enhanced if it includes, or is contiguous with, a domain of indeterminacy in which fixed relationships are partially freed to form other {{patterns}}. The boundary between the two {{domains}} requires special protection because of the tendency of unharmonious relationships to accumulate there in an uncontrolled manner.

## Domain Placeholders

This archetypal pattern uses the following domain-specific placeholders:

- `{{domains}}` → Physical: regions/areas | Social: functional domains/communities | Conceptual: knowledge domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{frameworks}}` → Physical: cities/infrastructure | Social: institutions/systems | Conceptual: paradigms/theories | Psychic: mental structures
- `{{elements}}` → Physical: materials/spaces | Social: members/participants | Conceptual: concepts/ideas | Psychic: perceptions/insights
- `{{organization-type}}` → Physical: building/development | Social: institution/community | Conceptual: framework/theory | Psychic: structured awareness
- `{{resources}}` → Physical: land/agriculture | Social: social resources | Conceptual: creative resources | Psychic: psychic resources
- `{{influence-type}}` → Physical: influence | Social: influence | Conceptual: insight | Psychic: influence
- `{{areas}}` → Physical: land/regions | Social: functional areas | Conceptual: domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{positions}}` → Physical: central locations | Social: central organizations | Conceptual: central frameworks | Psychic: ordered modes
- `{{patterns}}` → Physical: urban environments | Social: organizational patterns | Conceptual: knowledge patterns | Psychic: awareness patterns
- `{{modes}}` → Physical: environments | Social: modes of organization | Conceptual: modes of organization | Psychic: modes of awareness

## Original Template

The significance of a domain of defined relationships is enhanced if it includes, or is contiguous with, a domain of indeterminacy in which fixed relationships are partially freed to form other patterns. The boundary between the two domains requires special protection because of the tendency of unharmonious relationships to accumulate there in an uncontrolled manner.
