# 12610210 - Four-level structural limit (Archetypal)

## Archetypal Pattern

Within any framework the number of structural levels varies, with the highest number of levels tending to occur towards the centre. It is desirable that the majority of structures should not have more than four levels because of the confusion that more complex structures tend to engender.

## Domain Placeholders
