# 12610030 - Interpretation of complementary modes of organization (Archetypal)

## Archetypal Pattern

A continuous pattern of {{organization-type}} and definition denies the existence and emergence of the underdefined and severely diminishes the value of major established {{patterns}} of {{organization-type}}. But the degree of integration of such major {{patterns}} is also valuable and potent. A compromise can be achieved by ensuring appropriate interpenetration of defined and underdefined {{modes}} of {{organization-type}} as complements.

## Domain Placeholders

This archetypal pattern uses the following domain-specific placeholders:

- `{{domains}}` → Physical: regions/areas | Social: functional domains/communities | Conceptual: knowledge domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{frameworks}}` → Physical: cities/infrastructure | Social: institutions/systems | Conceptual: paradigms/theories | Psychic: mental structures
- `{{elements}}` → Physical: materials/spaces | Social: members/participants | Conceptual: concepts/ideas | Psychic: perceptions/insights
- `{{organization-type}}` → Physical: building/development | Social: institution/community | Conceptual: framework/theory | Psychic: structured awareness
- `{{resources}}` → Physical: land/agriculture | Social: social resources | Conceptual: creative resources | Psychic: psychic resources
- `{{influence-type}}` → Physical: influence | Social: influence | Conceptual: insight | Psychic: influence
- `{{areas}}` → Physical: land/regions | Social: functional areas | Conceptual: domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{positions}}` → Physical: central locations | Social: central organizations | Conceptual: central frameworks | Psychic: ordered modes
- `{{patterns}}` → Physical: urban environments | Social: organizational patterns | Conceptual: knowledge patterns | Psychic: awareness patterns
- `{{modes}}` → Physical: environments | Social: modes of organization | Conceptual: modes of organization | Psychic: modes of awareness

## Original Template

A continuous pattern of organization and definition denies the existence and emergence of the underdefined and severely diminishes the value of major established patterns of organization. But the degree of integration of such major patterns is also valuable and potent. A compromise can be achieved by ensuring appropriate interpenetration of defined and underdefined modes of organization as complements.
