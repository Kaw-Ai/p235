# Archetypal Patterns

This directory contains archetypal patterns generated from UIA templates using the format:
**"some-generic {{domain-specific}} more-generic"**

## What are Archetypal Patterns?

Archetypal patterns are abstracted versions of the UIA template patterns where domain-specific terms have been replaced with placeholders. This allows the same organizational principle to be applied across different domains (Physical, Social, Conceptual, Psychic) by substituting appropriate domain-specific vocabulary.

## Pattern Format

Each archetypal pattern includes:

1. **Archetypal Pattern**: The template text with domain-specific placeholders
2. **Domain Placeholders**: Explanation of how placeholders map to different domains  
3. **Original Template**: The original template text for reference

## Usage

To use an archetypal pattern:

1. Select the appropriate domain (Physical, Social, Conceptual, or Psychic)
2. Replace each `{{placeholder}}` with the corresponding domain-specific term
3. The result will be a domain-specific version of the organizational principle

## Pattern Statistics

- **Total UIA patterns analyzed**: 253
- **Patterns with Template sections**: 102 (suitable for archetypal patterns)
- **Patterns with domain-specific only**: 151 (Physical, Social, Conceptual, Psychic sections only)
- **Complete archetypal patterns** (with all 5 sections): 66

## Generated Files

102 archetypal patterns have been generated from the UIA patterns that contain Template sections. These represent the complete set of archetypal organizational principles that can be transformed across domains.

The format follows: **"generic-terms {{domain-specific-placeholder}} more-generic-terms"**

Example transformations:
- `{{domains}}` becomes "regions" (Physical), "communities" (Social), "knowledge domains" (Conceptual), "modes of awareness" (Psychic)
- `{{frameworks}}` becomes "infrastructure" (Physical), "institutions" (Social), "paradigms" (Conceptual), "mental structures" (Psychic)
- `{{resources}}` becomes "land/agriculture" (Physical), "social resources" (Social), "creative resources" (Conceptual), "psychic resources" (Psychic)
