# 12610180 - Network of redefinitions (Archetypal)

## Archetypal Pattern

In a context in which a particular form of order is self-reinforcing at all points, the {{elements}} constituting that order do not contribute to the redefinition of it or to the emergence of any new pattern. Such pattern emergences occur when the {{elements}} are able progressively to redefine their relationship to each other in the light of their past patterning experience.

## Domain Placeholders

This archetypal pattern uses the following domain-specific placeholders:

- `{{domains}}` → Physical: regions/areas | Social: functional domains/communities | Conceptual: knowledge domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{frameworks}}` → Physical: cities/infrastructure | Social: institutions/systems | Conceptual: paradigms/theories | Psychic: mental structures
- `{{elements}}` → Physical: materials/spaces | Social: members/participants | Conceptual: concepts/ideas | Psychic: perceptions/insights
- `{{organization-type}}` → Physical: building/development | Social: institution/community | Conceptual: framework/theory | Psychic: structured awareness
- `{{resources}}` → Physical: land/agriculture | Social: social resources | Conceptual: creative resources | Psychic: psychic resources
- `{{influence-type}}` → Physical: influence | Social: influence | Conceptual: insight | Psychic: influence
- `{{areas}}` → Physical: land/regions | Social: functional areas | Conceptual: domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{positions}}` → Physical: central locations | Social: central organizations | Conceptual: central frameworks | Psychic: ordered modes
- `{{patterns}}` → Physical: urban environments | Social: organizational patterns | Conceptual: knowledge patterns | Psychic: awareness patterns
- `{{modes}}` → Physical: environments | Social: modes of organization | Conceptual: modes of organization | Psychic: modes of awareness

## Original Template

In a context in which a particular form of order is self-reinforcing at all points, the elements constituting that order do not contribute to the redefinition of it or to the emergence of any new pattern. Such pattern emergences occur when the elements are able progressively to redefine their relationship to each other in the light of their past patterning experience.
