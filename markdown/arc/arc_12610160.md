# 12610160 - Web of general interrelationships (Archetypal)

## Archetypal Pattern

A general system of interrelationships can only work if all the parts are well-connected. This tends not to be the case because of the privileged role accorded to the major relationships and the difficulty of linking relationships of different kinds. This difficulty can be reduced by treating the interrelationship nodes as primary and the interrelationship links as secondary.

## Domain Placeholders

This archetypal pattern uses the following domain-specific placeholders:

- `{{domains}}` → Physical: regions/areas | Social: functional domains/communities | Conceptual: knowledge domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{frameworks}}` → Physical: cities/infrastructure | Social: institutions/systems | Conceptual: paradigms/theories | Psychic: mental structures
- `{{elements}}` → Physical: materials/spaces | Social: members/participants | Conceptual: concepts/ideas | Psychic: perceptions/insights
- `{{organization-type}}` → Physical: building/development | Social: institution/community | Conceptual: framework/theory | Psychic: structured awareness
- `{{resources}}` → Physical: land/agriculture | Social: social resources | Conceptual: creative resources | Psychic: psychic resources
- `{{influence-type}}` → Physical: influence | Social: influence | Conceptual: insight | Psychic: influence
- `{{areas}}` → Physical: land/regions | Social: functional areas | Conceptual: domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{positions}}` → Physical: central locations | Social: central organizations | Conceptual: central frameworks | Psychic: ordered modes
- `{{patterns}}` → Physical: urban environments | Social: organizational patterns | Conceptual: knowledge patterns | Psychic: awareness patterns
- `{{modes}}` → Physical: environments | Social: modes of organization | Conceptual: modes of organization | Psychic: modes of awareness
