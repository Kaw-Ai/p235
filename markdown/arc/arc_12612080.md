# 12612080 - Progressive framework definition (Archetypal)

## Archetypal Pattern

In order to accommodate subtle design adaptations as the need for them becomes clear, the framework should be conceived from the start as globally complete although tentative in its definition. In subsequent construction phases, as further {{elements}} are woven into the framework, it acquires increasing definition up to the final phase at which its full structural integrity is achieved.

## Domain Placeholders

This archetypal pattern uses the following domain-specific placeholders:

- `{{domains}}` → Physical: regions/areas | Social: functional domains/communities | Conceptual: knowledge domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{frameworks}}` → Physical: cities/infrastructure | Social: institutions/systems | Conceptual: paradigms/theories | Psychic: mental structures
- `{{elements}}` → Physical: materials/spaces | Social: members/participants | Conceptual: concepts/ideas | Psychic: perceptions/insights
- `{{organization-type}}` → Physical: building/development | Social: institution/community | Conceptual: framework/theory | Psychic: structured awareness
- `{{resources}}` → Physical: land/agriculture | Social: social resources | Conceptual: creative resources | Psychic: psychic resources
- `{{influence-type}}` → Physical: influence | Social: influence | Conceptual: insight | Psychic: influence
- `{{areas}}` → Physical: land/regions | Social: functional areas | Conceptual: domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{positions}}` → Physical: central locations | Social: central organizations | Conceptual: central frameworks | Psychic: ordered modes
- `{{patterns}}` → Physical: urban environments | Social: organizational patterns | Conceptual: knowledge patterns | Psychic: awareness patterns
- `{{modes}}` → Physical: environments | Social: modes of organization | Conceptual: modes of organization | Psychic: modes of awareness

## Original Template

In order to accommodate subtle design adaptations as the need for them becomes clear, the framework should be conceived from the start as globally complete although tentative in its definition. In subsequent construction phases, as further elements are woven into the framework, it acquires increasing definition up to the final phase at which its full structural integrity is achieved.
