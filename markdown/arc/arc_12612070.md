# 12612070 - Appropriate construction elements (Archetypal)

## Archetypal Pattern

Standardized {{elements}} used in the construction of any framework tend to prevent the emergence of any organic quality. Appropriate construction {{elements}} are required which are small in scale, easy to work with using accessible techniques, easy to adapt, capable of ensuring structural integrity, durable or renewable, not needing specialized or expensive assistance, and universally obtainable at low cost. Isolating such {{elements}} from the environment should neither unduly deplete the environment nor prevent their reintegration into it when the framework is no longer required.

## Domain Placeholders

- `{{domains}}` → Physical: regions/areas | Social: functional domains/communities | Conceptual: knowledge domains | Psychic: modes of awareness

- `{{influence-type}}` → Physical: influence | Social: influence | Conceptual: insight | Psychic: influence
- `{{areas}}` → Physical: land/regions | Social: functional areas | Conceptual: domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{positions}}` → Physical: central locations | Social: central organizations | Conceptual: central frameworks | Psychic: ordered modes
- `{{patterns}}` → Physical: urban environments | Social: organizational patterns | Conceptual: knowledge patterns | Psychic: awareness patterns
- `{{modes}}` → Physical: environments | Social: modes of organization | Conceptual: modes of organization | Psychic: modes of awareness
