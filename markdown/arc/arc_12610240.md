# 12610240 - Positions enabling transcendence (Archetypal)

## Archetypal Pattern

In any domain there are points which provide a focus for the relationships between other points. Such a focal point or "centre of gravity" serves an integrative function through which the domain may both itself be integrated as well as being related as a whole to {{frameworks}} which transcend the boundary of the domain.

## Domain Placeholders

This archetypal pattern uses the following domain-specific placeholders:

- `{{domains}}` → Physical: regions/areas | Social: functional domains/communities | Conceptual: knowledge domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{frameworks}}` → Physical: cities/infrastructure | Social: institutions/systems | Conceptual: paradigms/theories | Psychic: mental structures
- `{{elements}}` → Physical: materials/spaces | Social: members/participants | Conceptual: concepts/ideas | Psychic: perceptions/insights
- `{{organization-type}}` → Physical: building/development | Social: institution/community | Conceptual: framework/theory | Psychic: structured awareness
- `{{resources}}` → Physical: land/agriculture | Social: social resources | Conceptual: creative resources | Psychic: psychic resources
- `{{influence-type}}` → Physical: influence | Social: influence | Conceptual: insight | Psychic: influence
- `{{areas}}` → Physical: land/regions | Social: functional areas | Conceptual: domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{positions}}` → Physical: central locations | Social: central organizations | Conceptual: central frameworks | Psychic: ordered modes
- `{{patterns}}` → Physical: urban environments | Social: organizational patterns | Conceptual: knowledge patterns | Psychic: awareness patterns
- `{{modes}}` → Physical: environments | Social: modes of organization | Conceptual: modes of organization | Psychic: modes of awareness

## Original Template

In any domain there are points which provide a focus for the relationships between other points. Such a focal point or "centre of gravity" serves an integrative function through which the domain may both itself be integrated as well as being related as a whole to frameworks which transcend the boundary of the domain.
