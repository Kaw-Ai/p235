# 12610100 - Access to intensity (Archetypal)

## Archetypal Pattern

Complexification of structures and processes at centralized locations constitute a powerful attractant but such development progressively limits access to the intensity of relationships in that environment. Access can be increased by limiting the degree of complexification and multiplying the number and variety of such points of focus.
