# 12612150 - Initial level formation (Archetypal)

## Archetypal Pattern

The easiest and most natural way to form the initial level of a framework is by enclosing an area of the domain on which it is located and reinforcing it with materials characteristic of that domain that ensure continuity and structural integrity in relation to the inter-level connections.

## Domain Placeholders

This archetypal pattern uses the following domain-specific placeholders:

- `{{domains}}` → Physical: regions/areas | Social: functional domains/communities | Conceptual: knowledge domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{frameworks}}` → Physical: cities/infrastructure | Social: institutions/systems | Conceptual: paradigms/theories | Psychic: mental structures
- `{{elements}}` → Physical: materials/spaces | Social: members/participants | Conceptual: concepts/ideas | Psychic: perceptions/insights
- `{{organization-type}}` → Physical: building/development | Social: institution/community | Conceptual: framework/theory | Psychic: structured awareness
- `{{resources}}` → Physical: land/agriculture | Social: social resources | Conceptual: creative resources | Psychic: psychic resources
- `{{influence-type}}` → Physical: influence | Social: influence | Conceptual: insight | Psychic: influence
- `{{areas}}` → Physical: land/regions | Social: functional areas | Conceptual: domains | Psychic: modes of awareness
- `{{positions}}` → Physical: central locations | Social: central organizations | Conceptual: central frameworks | Psychic: ordered modes
- `{{patterns}}` → Physical: urban environments | Social: organizational patterns | Conceptual: knowledge patterns | Psychic: awareness patterns
