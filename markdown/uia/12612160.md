# 12612160 - Inter-level connections

## Template

Inter-level connections are of prime significance in any framework and should enhance this impression by the manner in which they are constructed and disposed. They should be easy to connect to other elements of the framework in order to establish structural integrity.

## Physical

In all the world's traditional and historic buildings, the columns are expressive, beautiful, and treasured elements. In modern buildings they have become ugly and meaningless because no one knows how to make a column which is at the same time beautiful and structurally efficient. This requires: solidity, especially when using ecologically sound materials of lower strength; inexpensive materials; pleasant surface finish, permitting heavy decoration; concentration of strength towards centre; easy connectibility to other elements; on-site modifiability and subsequent repairability.
