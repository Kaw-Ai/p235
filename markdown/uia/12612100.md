# 12612100 - Harmonizing space distribution between levels

## Template

In order to maintain the integrity of the framework, the boundaries of spaces at a higher level should not be too distant from boundaries to which those forces can be distributed at the lower level beneath it.

## Physical

The floor and ceiling layout must correspond to the important social spaces which will vary from floor to floor. If the spaces are vaulted to permit uses of compression materials only, vaults on different floors do not have to be aligned. To maintain reasonable structural integrity in the system of vaults as a whole, it is sufficient if a vault is placed so that its loads come down in a position from which the forces can spread out downward in a 45 degree cone and be supported by columns of the next vault down.
