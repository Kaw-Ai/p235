# 12610510 - Linear relationships enhanced by non-linear processes

## Template

Local linear relationships may be enhanced by ensuring the presence of non-linear processes such that the linearity tends to become implicit rather than explicit.

## Physical

Local asphalt roads destroy the micro- climate and the local environment. Substituting paving stones with grass between them alleviates such effects.
