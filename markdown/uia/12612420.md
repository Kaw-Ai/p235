# 12612420 - Intermediate position

## Template

Establishing an intermediate position between exposure to a wider range of influences and enclosure within a more controlled environment is strategically advantageous. Such a position is attractive because it facilitates choice of the degree of exposure acceptable at any one time.

## Physical
