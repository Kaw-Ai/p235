# 12612090 - Organization of integrative superstructure

## Template

Each distinct portion of the integrative superstructure should correspond to an identifiable set of spaces within the framework. The layout will span the largest spaces and it is to them that those spanning lesser spaces should be connected in a self-reinforcing cascade down to those spanning the smallest spaces.

## Physical

Arrange the roofs of a building so that each distinct roof corresponds to an identifiable social span in the building. Place the largest roofs - those which are the highest and have the largest span - over the most important and most communal spaces; build the lesser roofs off these largest and highest roofs; and build the smallest roofs of all off these lesser roofs, in the form of half-vaults and sheds over alcoves and thick walls. The overall arrangement should form a self- buttressing cascade in which each lower roof helps to take up the horizontal thrust generated by the higher roofs.
