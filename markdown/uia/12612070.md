# 12612070 - Appropriate construction elements

## Template

Standardized elements used in the construction of any framework tend to prevent the emergence of any organic quality. Appropriate construction elements are required which are small in scale, easy to work with using accessible techniques, easy to adapt, capable of ensuring structural integrity, durable or renewable, not needing specialized or expensive assistance, and universally obtainable at low cost. Isolating such elements from the environment should neither unduly deplete the environment nor prevent their reintegration into it when the framework is no longer required.

## Physical

Mass-produced construction materials tend to destroy the organic quality of natural buildings and to make any such quality impossible. Appropriate materials are required which are small in scale, easy to cut on site, easy to work without sophisticated machinery, easy to vary and adapt, heavy enough to be solid, long-lasting or easy to maintain, and yet easy to build, not needing specialized labour, not expensive in labour, and universally obtainable and cheap. Such materials should be ecologically sound, namely biodegradable, low in energy consumption, and not based on depletable resources.
