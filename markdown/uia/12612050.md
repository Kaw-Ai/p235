# 12612050 - Congruence between spaces defined by the framework and spaces defined by the processes within it

## Template

No framework is every felt to be appropriate unless the spaces defined within it by boundaries and inter-level connections are congruent with the spaces defined by the pattern of movement within it. Formal construction constraints should not dictate the final form of the framework.

## Physical

No building ever feels right to the people in it unless the physical spaces (defined by columns, walls and ceilings) are congruent with the social spaces (defined by activities and human groups). The social spaces should never be modified to conform to the engineering structure.
