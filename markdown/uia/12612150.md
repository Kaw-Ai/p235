# 12612150 - Initial level formation

## Template

The easiest and most natural way to form the initial level of a framework is by enclosing an area of the domain on which it is located and reinforcing it with materials characteristic of that domain that ensure continuity and structural integrity in relation to the inter-level connections.

## Physical

The slab is the easiest, cheapest, and most natural way to lay a ground floor. It is constructed by first building a low perimeter wall around the building, tying it with the column foundations, and then filling it with rubble, gravel and concrete.
