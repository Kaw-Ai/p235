# 12612140 - Integrative infrastructure

## Template

The best form of infrastructure is continuous with the overlying framework whose pattern of inter-level connections is then embedded in the context in a manner entirely integral with it.

## Physical

The best foundations are like those of a tree where the entire structure of the tree simply continues below ground level, creating a system entirely integral with the ground so as to resist tension and horizontal shear as well as compression.
