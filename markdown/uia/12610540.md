# 12610540 - Intersection of differently paced communications

## Template

Wherever a network of lower intensity relationships is exposed to one of higher intensity, the intersection should be designed such as to protect the integrity of the latter.

## Physical

Where pedestrian pathways cross roads, the crossing should be protected by, for example, providing islands between the lanes and ensuring its recognition by drivers.
