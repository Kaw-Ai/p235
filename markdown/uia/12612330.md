# 12612330 - Zoning internal domains

## Template

Some functions associated with internal domains tend to be associated with characteristics of the external environment whereas others are not. Zones may be established within the internal domain to reflect this distinction and to adapt the zones' characteristics accordingly.

## Physical

Zones may be established in a house or building with harder floor materials in the public areas and softer materials in the private or more intimate zones. This avoids the problem arising from the exposure of comfortable but difficult-to-clean materials to foot traffic from the external environment. The distinction between the zones may be emphasized by a step, with different footwear rules on each side of the step.
