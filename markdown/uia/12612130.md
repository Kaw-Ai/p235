# 12612130 - Distribution of secondary inter-level connections

## Template

Secondary inter-level connections may be required to reinforce the boundary between the primary inter-level connections positioned at transitions in boundary orientation. Such secondary connections should be distributed according to the proportions of the multi-level framework as a whole and of the bounded spaces within any given level.

## Physical

Once spaces have been defined by corner columns, columns are required to stiffen the walls between them. They should be furthest apart on the ground floor (higher walls) and progressively closer together on higher floors (lower walls). On any one floor they should be equally spaced, but closer together along the walls of small rooms and further apart along the walls of large rooms.
