# 12610490 - Local relationship loops

## Template

To ensure the adaptive interactions difficult with general or global relationships, local relationships should be arranged in loops, such that the loops do not facilitate relationships between more distant points.

## Physical

Local roads should be laid out in the form of loops such as to provide access to houses but not to offer any advantages to through traffic seeking a short-cut.

## Social

Communication pathways between groups with closely related concerns should be based on circuits structured to facilitate low-key interaction amongst those groups but to offer no advantages to external communications seeking to use them to establish more efficient relationships between distant groups.

## Conceptual

Closely related specialized conceptual domains should be interlinked by self-reinforcing cycles of interaction which are of little significance as a means of establishing more general patterns of relationship between more distant domains.

## Psychic

Closely related patterns of perceptions should be interlinked within a specialized mode of awareness by cycles of self-reinforcement which are of little significance as a means of integrating more general modes of awareness.
