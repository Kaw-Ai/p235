# 12610480 - Adaptive interstices

## Template

Wherever there tends to be a sharp boundary between zones that are active throughout the time cycle and those active for only part of it, the presence of sub-zones of the former type scattered throughout those of the latter ensures the necessary maintenance of rhythms in the partially active zones.

## Physical

Wherever there tends to be a sharp separation between residential and non-residential areas, building occasional houses into the fabric of shops, factories and public buildings ensures that the non-residential area is lived-in and does not deteriorate into a slum area.

## Social

Wherever there tends to be a sharp separation in an organizational complex between functions or programmes active throughout the time cycle and those active in part of the time cycle only, integrating some communal or family groups into the structure of the latter reduces their vulnerability when they are inactive.

## Conceptual

Wherever there tends to be a sharp distinction made in a conceptual domain between processes active throughout the time cycle and those active for only part of it, integrating some continually active processes into the latter reduces their vulnerability to conditions prevailing when they are inactive.

## Psychic

Wherever there tends to be a sharp separation mode within a mode of awareness between perceptual processes intertwining throughout the daily cycle and those active for only part of it, integrating some of the ongoing processes into the latter reduces their vulnerability to impressions engendered when they are inactive.
