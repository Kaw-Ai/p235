# 12612190 - Level generation of minimum tension

## Template

Generation of a usable new level on a framework calls for a design which will ensure that minimum distortion and tension is engendered by the addition.

## Physical

Elliptical vaults will support a live load on the floor above, whilst forming the ceiling of the room below, and generating minimum bending and tension so that inexpensive compressive materials can be relied on. They can be fitted to rooms of any shape.
