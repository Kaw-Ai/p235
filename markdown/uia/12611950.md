# 12611950 - Framework for transition between structural levels

## Physical

Staircase space requirement.

## Broader Patterns

- [External access to higher structural levels](12611580)
- [Integrating points of perspective into common domains](12611250)
- [Integrating transition pathways between levels into a structure](12611330)

## Narrower Patterns

- [Exclusive spaces for emergent perspectives](12612030)
- [Appropriate superstructure to contain transitions between levels](12612280)
- [Primary inter-level connections at transitions in boundary orientation](12612120)
