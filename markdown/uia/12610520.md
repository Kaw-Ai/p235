# 12610520 - Interfacing vehicles of communication and networks of unmediated relationships

## Template

Vehicles of communication may endanger the local communication process although significant activities occur at the points at which they interface with zones of unmediated relationships. A protected network of unmediated relationships may be developed distinct from that of the mediated network and orthogonal to it.

## Physical

Automobiles are dangerous to pedestrians and yet social life is enlivened at the points where they meet. A protected network of pedestrian paths may be developed, distinct from the road system, and orthogonal to it.
