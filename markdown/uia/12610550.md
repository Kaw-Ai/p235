# 12610550 - Protected low intensity relationships

## Template

In order to prevent high intensity relationships from acquiring disproportionate significance, low intensity relationships should be given a prominent position, especially where they have a common boundary with those of high intensity.

## Physical

Pedestrian sidewalks should be raised 0.5 metres above the level of parallel roads carrying fast-moving traffic, with some form of railing to mark the edge, or else pedestrians feel overwhelmed by the vehicles.
