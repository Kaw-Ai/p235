# 12612510 - Different settings

## Template

A space can only be effectively used in all its richness if it can be appreciated from a variety of settings according to the felt need of the moment. Efforts to standardize such settings imposes a subtle straightjacket on the manner in which the space is experienced.

## Physical

Provision of a variety of chairs in a space, as opposed to chairs of a single design conceived for an "average person". The latter approach is insensitive to the variety of people, to their sitting habits and to the different needs of any one individual at different times.

## Social

Recognition of a variety of roles in a social space, in contrast to trends towards achieving a degree of role uniformity.

## Conceptual

Recognition of a variety of viewpoints in a conceptual domain, in contrast to trends towards achieving a single acceptable viewpoint.

## Psychic

Acceptance of a variety of modes of awareness, in contrast to any trend towards achieving a single unvariegated mode.
