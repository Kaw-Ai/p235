# 12610450 - Local action network

## Template

A local focal point only acquires significance in a domain when it is embedded in a local action network whose activities it facilitates.

## Physical

A local town hall functions more effectively when it surrounds itself with shop-size spaces available to community action groups. Availability of low-cost office space is a vital catalyst to the initiatives of effective group action.

## Social

A common service environment can only be effective when it is embedded in a network of specialized action projects, each testing its views within the community and mobilizing support and resources. Such a network is basic to the self-regulation of any community.

## Conceptual

An integrative common framework only acquires significance in a specialized conceptual domain when it is embedded in a network of investigative initiatives whose activities it facilitates.

## Psychic

A focal insight only acquires significance within any specialized mode of awareness when it is embedded within a network perception whose value it enhances.
