# 12612350 - Unalienating internal boundaries

## Template

Flawless unmalleable internal boundaries provide no basis for further interaction with them. They are difficult to modify in the light of emerging requirements. Malleable and essentially unfinished boundaries encourage continuing interaction throughout their duration.

## Physical

Make inside surfaces warm to the touch with a slight "give" as with soft plaster, or organic materials. A wall which is too hard or too cold or too solid is unpleasant to touch; it makes decoration impossible and creates hollow echoes.
