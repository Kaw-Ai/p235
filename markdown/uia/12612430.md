# 12612430 - Ambiguous boundaries

## Template

There are situations in which the boundaries between spaces are too absolute, but the absence of any boundary would do an injustice to the subtlety of the division between them. Ambiguous boundaries may than be established which both distinguish and bind together.

## Physical

In many places, walls and fences between outdoor spaces are too high, even though some separating boundary is required. In such situations, very low walls may be built so that when sat upon in various ways, or stepped over, the connection between the spaces is emphasized.

## Social

In the relationships between groups there are situations in which the boundary between them should be highly permeable, such that participants feel free to shift between actions within one group to those in another, or that there should be an acceptable ambiguity as to which group they are acting for at any one time.

## Conceptual

In the relationship between conceptual frameworks, there are situations in which it is advantageous to be able to shift easily between conceptualization in terms of one to that in terms of the other, accepting a certain ambiguity as to which is appropriate at any one time.

## Psychic

In the relationship between different modes of awareness there are situations in which it is advantageous for the person to be able to shift freely between distinct modes such that there is some ambiguity as to which is valid in a given set of circumstances.
