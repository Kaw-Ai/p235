# 12612460 - Integration within context

## Template

A collective framework is successfully integrated within its natural environment when variable processes in that context interact with it as freely as they would if it were natural to that context.

## Physical

A building finally becomes part of its surroundings when plants grow over parts of it as freely as they grow over the ground. In so doing, they effect a smooth transition between the built and the natural, whether in terms of light quality or texture.

## Social

An organization becomes a natural part of the community in which it is located when its boundary as a social group offers many points of contact to the informal processes occurring within the community.

## Conceptual

A conceptual framework is successfully integrated into the conceptual domain to which it relates when it is accepted as offering support for the variety of informal creation processes associated with that domain.

## Psychic

A psychological construct or mode of awareness is successfully integrated into a person's psychic framework when it supports and reinforces the person's other unstructured modes of awareness.
