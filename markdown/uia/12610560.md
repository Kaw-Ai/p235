# 12610560 - Special modes of relationship

## Template

Some beneficial modes of relationship cannot be satisfactorily combined with others and call for the establishment of a distinct network with appropriate adaptation at the interfaces with other modes.

## Physical

Bicycles are endangered by other vehicles on roads and are themselves a danger to pedestrians on pathways, despite being a healthy mode of transport with little negative impact on the environment. This calls for the establishment of a system of appropriately adapted bicycle paths with bike racks located close to common destinations.
